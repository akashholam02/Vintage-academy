    <div id="intro">
        <p class="intro-1">
            1729 Vintage Academy Pvt. Ltd. was founded in 2017 by Mr. Dnyaneshwar Mutkule, a Metallurgy and Material Science engineer from the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). After completing his graduation, Dnyaneshwar Sir worked as a Graduate Engineer Trainee at Bharat Forge in Baramati in 2015. During this time, he started teaching a small group of students in his vicinity. The remarkable progress of these students led to an increasing number of learners joining in, and this became the foundation of 1729 Vintage Academy.<br><br><br>
        
            With a strong vision to bridge the information gap in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, 1729 Acharya Academy was formally established in 2017 to provide quality education, mentorship, and exposure to talented students who lack the right guidance.

            <p class="aboutus">At 1729 Acharya Academy, we believe that every student deserves the right mentorship and resources to excel in competitive exams. High achievers from prestigious institutions often do not pursue teaching due to compensation disparity and lack of ownership. We are addressing this gap by collaborating with top performers from IITs, COEP, NITs, and IIMs, bringing the best academic minds to mentor our students.</p>
