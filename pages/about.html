            1729 Vintage Academy Pvt. Ltd. was founded in 2017 by Mr. Dnyaneshwar Mutkule, a Metallurgy and Material Science engineer from the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). After completing his graduation, Dnyaneshwar Sir worked as a Graduate Engineer Trainee at Bharat Forge in Baramati in 2015. During this time, he started teaching a small group of students in his vicinity. The remarkable progress of these students led to an increasing number of learners joining in, and this became the foundation of 1729 Vintage Academy.
